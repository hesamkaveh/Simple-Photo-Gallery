# What is this app?
This is a small and simple as possible website for an applying job.

I used React, Typescript, redux-rematch and jss to create this simple app.

I didn't use any pre-made UI Kit library like MUI or AntD.

# DEMO
### Is available on [Netlify](/)

# How to Run?
 - create ''.env'' file like ''.env.sample''
 - ```yarn install```
 - ```yarn start```

## Logic is testable via jest. Execute ```yarn test```
